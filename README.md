# satellite-nn
A deep learning satellite simulation where the AI learns to launch itself into orbit at a specified height above earth.

## How it works
The model is currently in training and thus will initialize randomly in this deployment.
### The Neural Network
The Neural Network has two hidden layers and the following inputs and outputs:
